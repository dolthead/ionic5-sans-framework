# Ionic in html and javacript

Fork this repo to have your own copy. Clone the fork to your machine. Open index.html and serve it. (I use the live server extension.)

https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/action-sheet

Change the framework selector to  "JavaScript" in the top, left menu.
The Ionic Components will be listed down the left side.

**1. Find the ion-spinner**. Compare the iOS and Android spinners. Notice the defaults, and primary, secondary, and tertiary versions. 

**2. Scroll down to the Usage section.** Compare Javascript with Angular and React. Use the copy button, and paste the code into your ionic project.

**3. Scroll down to the Properties section.** What are the 4 properties. Are any required? When might you use the *paused* property?

**4. Scroll back up to the View Source link (under the examples screen).** This link will open the github repo of Ionic examples in a new tab. Return to the help doc, and choose which spinner you want to copy and use. Open the View Source code, find the code for the spinner you want, copy the code, and paste it into your Ionic project.
